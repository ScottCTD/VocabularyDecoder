# What is "Vocabulary Decoder"?

As the word "Decoder" implies, vocabulary decoder (VD) is a tool, aiming to help non-native English learner effectively memorize English Vocabularies. ScottCTD created this small tool.

## How to use it?

Choose a VD mode from the **"VD Mode Selection"**, and then hit **"Confirm"** to continue.

VD has many **internal vocabulary lists**, ranging from TOEFL vocabularies to SAT vocabularies, and more lists will be added in the future.

If you want to create **your customized vocabulary lists**, just go to the **"tools"** menu at the **top** of the Lists Selection windows.
